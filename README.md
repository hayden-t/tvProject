# tvProject

Hackaday prize/project entry https://hackaday.io/project/191317-automated-video-playout-for-matv-featuring-opencv

Check branches for content

branch 700 has the "Live Events" system which is written in python and features remote control web interface, but vlc is still daemoned through cron

branch 703 has web based Playlist Editor, but newer vlc daemon with supervisor and control via rc interface

branch tracking has the python scripts for motion tracking and PTZ IP camera control

Eventually I plan to merge branches, and rewrite the playlist editor and motion tracker
